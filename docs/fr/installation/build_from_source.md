# Building from source
People who are taking this approach are expected to be familiar with how this is done (cloning, building, etc.)

This command will build Amethyst for your system in the `./release/build` folder

## Windows
```sh
$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/geoxor/amethyst \
  && cd amethyst \
  && yarn \
  && yarn package 
```

## Linux
⚠️ If you're on Linux the command above will attempt to compile for 
`AppImage`, `deb`, `rpm` and `snap`. It will most likely fail as you're going to be missing the
dependencies required to build them.

**You should do something like the following:**

```sh
$ yarn package --linux dir # builds into "release/build/linux-unpacked"
```

```sh
$ yarn package --linux deb # builds into a deb package
```

```sh
$ yarn package --linux appimage # builds into an appimage
```

More information about manual packaging arguments can be found in the [electron-builder documentation](https://www.electron.build/configuration/linux.html)
